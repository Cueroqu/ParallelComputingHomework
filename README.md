ParallelComputingHomework
=========================

1.  Radix Sort
    radixSort\radixSort.cpp
    More details can be found @ radixSort\readme.txt

2.  Closet Pair
    closetPair\closetPair.cpp
    More details can be found @ closetPair\readme.txt

3.  Conjugate Gradient Method
    cg\cg.cpp
    More details can be found @ cg\readme.txt

4.  Optional Problem
    I chose to implement two other sorting algorithms that share alike form with radix sort, namely parallel sorting by regular sampling and odd-even sort.
    Parallel Sorting by Regular Sampling (PSRS): an more uniform sorting algorithm of the one presented at section 5.1.
        psrs\psrs.cpp
        More details can be found @ psrs\readme.txt
    Odd-Even Sort:
        oddEvenSort\oddEvenSort.cpp
        More details can be found @ oddEvenSort\readme.txt
